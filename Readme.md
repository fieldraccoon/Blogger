This is a simple project for myself to learn some node.js

You can Create a post and it appears on the home screen. 

If you want to Read further you can expand the post and renders a seperate page.

Logging in and registering works on my database but not on the web app.

This will do for now and if i want to fix it and make the project better later on i will do but likely not going to.
